**[Link to Warhammer site](https://www.cubicle7games.com/our-games/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay/)**


<a brief but clear understanding of why someone should be interested>
Want to play Warhammer Fantasy RPG with remote friends in a telegram chat?
For example, you can attack, defend, use a skill etcâ€¦


<how do I set this up>

## Summary
It's free to run your own bot for your games.  Only one person needs to setup the bot and everyone else just needs a telegram account and a private telegram chat with the bot and all members.
	
## Bot Usage
Type "/h" in a telegram chat group where the bot is present to get a list of available commands.

example:
	
	1. A player with a melee skill of 50 would type:  /a 50 

		the script will roll to attack and show the attacker's SL ("Success Level"):
		[ATT @John][SL:+3][Bi:Main Arm|Quad:Body][Roll:23] 
	
	2. The defender with a melee skill of 40 would type: /d 40
		
		the script will roll to defend and show the defender's SL.
		[DEF @John][SL:+2][Bi:Main Arm|Quad:Body][Roll:23] 
			
	3. Results include hit locations (biped and quadruped), crits, fumbles, impales, blackpowder missfires, etc.
