Dice Rolling Bot for playing Warhammer Fantasy Role Playing 4th Ed (WFRP)

**[Link to Warhammer site](https://www.cubicle7games.com/our-games/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay/)**


<a brief but clear understanding of why someone should be interested>
Want to play Warhammer Fantasy RPG with remote friends in a telegram chat?
For example, you can attack, defend, use a skill etcâ€¦


<how do I set this up>

## Summary
It's free to run your own bot for your games.  Only one person needs to setup the bot and everyone else just needs a telegram account and a private telegram chat with the bot and all members.
	
## Bot Usage
Type "/h" in a telegram chat group where the bot is present to get a list of available commands.

example:
	
	1. **ATTACK**: A player with a melee skill of 50 would type:  /a 50 

		The script will roll to attack and show the attacker's SL ("Success Level"):
		[ATT @John][SL:+3][Bi:Main Arm|Quad:Body][Roll:23] 
	
	2. **DEFEND**: The defender with a melee skill of 40 would type: /d 40
		
		The script will roll to defend and show the defender's SL.
		[DEF @Colin][SL:+2][Bi:Main Arm|Quad:Body][Roll:23] 
	
		The result of SL: +2 from Colin's defense is compared to John's attack at SL: +3.  
		In this case John scores a hit at +1 SL vs Colin's defense.
	
	3. **SKILLS**: A player using a skill of level 58 would type: /s 58
	
		The script will roll and display the results from the outcome table.
		[SKILL @Mike] [SL:-1] [Roll:60]
		[Marginal FAILURE] : You marginally fail, perhaps accomplishing a portion of what you intended.
	
	4. **DICE**: Roll dice with /r.  Results include 1d100, 1d10, and 2d10.
	
		[Roll @Jason]: 1d100=58          1d10=1          2d10=10
	
	5. Results include hit locations (biped and quadruped), crits, fumbles, impales, blackpowder missfires, etc.
	
		For example, a player using a skill might roll with /s 64 and get the following critical on "doubles":
		[SKILL @Daniel] [SL:+5] {CRIT!} [Roll:11]
